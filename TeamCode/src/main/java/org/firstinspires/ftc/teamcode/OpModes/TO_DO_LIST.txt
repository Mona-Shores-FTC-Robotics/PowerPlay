    Driver practice - first 10s - fast movement to alliance substation
    Driver practice - first 10s - quick score on opposite alliance station ground junction
    Driver practice - 10s-70s alliance station focus - repeated quick score on close high junction
    Driver practice - 10s-70s cone stack focus
    Driver practice - 70s-90s circuit offense/defense - scatter cone placements to different poles
    Driver practice - 90s-120s end game - picking up and placing beacon
    Driver practice - 90s-120s end game - circuit defense
    Driver practice - 90s-120s end game - circuit offense
    Driver practice - pole naming convention

Todo: Cleanup Telemetry - can we organize the telemtry better?
